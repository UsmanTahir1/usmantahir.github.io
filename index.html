						<h3>Assignment Description</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 16px">I run into most problem during task 1 where I was faced with a plethora of bugs both big and small. However, I did not falter in the face of this horror. Rather I persevered with sheer will and the aid of those I call my friends I vanquished all the bugs.  
  
							My journey began with docker on windows. After having faced my first error, I quickly shifted gears and went with linux. There too I faced a new error (and loneliness since no one else I knew was using linux). Thus I finally decided to go with windows and the rest is history.  
							
							Here I shall chronicle my journey in two phases.  
						   <ol style="color: white">
							<li>Printing OK</li>
							<li>Printing NUST Logo</li>
						  </ol>
						  
						</p>

						<h4 style="color: white">
							1. Printing OK
						</h4>

						<p>
													I started with by downloading docker and qemu. Then I made a Dockerfile for describing all the steps to make my enviornment image. This file was run on cmd to build the image.   

						I then ran code on cmd to create an instance of the image i.e the container. Now I had access to the virtual machine.  

						Made a boot loader in header.asm file locate the OS. Then I made main.asm file as the entry point to OS.  

						Then I made linker file to link the OS together followed by grub.cfg file that will create the iso file to host OS.  

						Now i made a Makerfile that hold all build commands for the OS.  

						Finally I ran the OS in Qemu and "OK" was printed.  
						</p>
						
						<h4 style="color: white">
							2. Printing NUST Logo
						</h4>

						<p>
							After accomplishing task 1, I did not face any errors. It was smooth sailing from here and I only had to follow the tutorial.  
  
First I modified the previous main.asm file.
<ol style="color: white">  
<li> Made two lables that reference top and bottom of the stack in .bss section which contains statically allocated variables. </li> 
<li>Made function that confirms that OS has been loaded by the mutipli-boot loader.  </li>
<li>Made function that checks CPU ID and gives CPU instructions. </li>
<li> Made function that checks for long mode support (64 bit).</li>
<li>We use virtual memory through paging to access 64bit mode.</li>
<li>Made two functions to allow paging. first to setup page table and second to enable paging.  </li>
</ol>
<p style="color: white">
New file main64.asm is created that is externally called by main.asm to enable long mode.   
Next kernel is built.  
Now a main.c file is created to use C code in. It is made in kernel subfolder. This code will print NUST logo. It is called in main6
.asm.  
Now an interface folder is created. which contains print.h file. This defines our printing interface.  
print.c file is created in x86_64 folder. This describes the characters to be printed. 
</p> 

	<ol style="color: white">  
	<li>Clear row function is created to print empty space. </li> 
	<li>print char function is created to print character at appropriate place.    </li>
	<li>New line function to move to next line. </li>
	<li>print_set_color() function is created for changing the color. </li>
	</ol>

						<p style="color: white">Finally Makerfile is updated to accomodate .c file.  			
							Finally I ran the output in Qemu.</p>
